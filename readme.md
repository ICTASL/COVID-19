# COVID-19 Backend Services

## Contributing
Please keep the following in mind when submitting your valuable contributions üòä
- Currently, all development is happening out of the master branch, so kindly fork it and make your changes there before submitting a PR.
- If you've implemented a new API, update the readme and [postman collection](../master/postman/COVID-19.postman_collection.json). This makes it so much easier for other developers to consume your APIs.
- Rebase your code before submitting PRs: `git pull --rebase upstream master` ensures there are no conflicts and keeps the tree clean!
- Comments are always encouraged - you never know who'll continue to work on your code next, so let's make their life a bit easier shall we üòâ
- Finally, see something wrong or have a suggestion? raise an [issue](https://github.com/azhamn/COVID-19/issues) so we can get working on it right away!

## How to run
- install mysql server
- execute `covid19.sql` on server (execute `covid19_test.sql` to add test data)
 
### Using the Maven Plugin
- replace the `covid-19-lk-dev-firebase-adminsdk.json` file in `/src/main/resources/credentials/` with the private key from Firebase Admin SDK
- run using: `mvn spring-boot:run`
- change `firebase.topic` in `application.yml` accordingly. `mobile_message` is used for production and `mobile_message_test` is used for testing

### As a Packaged Application
- build project using `mvn clean install`
- copy `application.yml` to the folder where the jar is (`target` if it has not been moved)
- create a new file `fcm.json` in the same folder, and copy 
contents of file `covid-19-lk-dev-firebase-adminsdk.json` in `/src/main/resources/credentials/` into the new `fcm.json`,
and add the private key from Firebase Admin SDK.
- change the value of `firebase.configurations.path` in application.yml to `file:fcm.json` or `file:<absolute path of fcm.json>` 
  (if the value of `firebase.configurations.path` is not changed, the json file bundled in the jar will be referred)
- go into the folder where the jar is (eg. `cd target`)
- run `java -jar covid19-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Check if the jar version matches.
- the access logs can be found in folder access located in the folder where tomcat is.
 (linux: /tmp/<latest_tomcat_folder>/access) These logs can be disabled from the application.yml

## Web Portal UI

### Getting started

#### Setting up Build system
- In order to Setup You need to Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Now Run `npm run watch`.
- All of the following folders are monitored for changes, which will tell the browser to reload automatically after any changes are made:
`Resources>Js`
-Now you can edit any html file inside the resource.

- Hit Ctrl+C or just close the command line window to stop the server.

#### Adding a New Web Page
- Create a html file in `src/main/resources/templates/`
- Create an endpoint in `WebPortalController` to serve the web page
- The endpoint must return a string which is the name of the html file (eg. `login` for login.html)
